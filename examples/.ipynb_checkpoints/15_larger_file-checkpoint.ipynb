    "1. It is not a good idea to directly use read_csv, because python will add a lot pointer under the hood, and each pointer will be 8 bytes, it is not cost-efficient. Also, the default dtype will consume a lot of memory, like int64 and float64. Brute force reading can take several hours and what's worse, the memory overhead.\n",

    "2. workaround:\n",
    "    - adjust dtype, using dtype option (a dict {col1:int16,col2:int8})\n",
    "    - chunk by chunk, using chunksize option, so construct a TextFileReader object, read chunk by chunk, then finally concat them together, for each chunk, you may consider cast their type to a more reasonable one. But concat will enforce uniform dtype, which is annoying though."
